The Time of the Game - Instructions for running/setup

STARTING
Cinema computer:
	[1] The fast way:  
		Go to the desktop, double click the startup.bat
		This will, in order, start the servers required, move the mouse, and open the web page in full screen mode
	[2] The slow way:  
		Start up the OSC bridge:
			Open a command prompt and navigate to the bridge.js file:
			cd C:\Users\OCR\Documents\GitHub\timeofthegame\sketches\osc-web-master\
			Then run the bridge.js by typing:
			node bridge.js
		Start the main server for the web page
			Open another command prompt and navigate to the dir:
			cd C:\Users\OCR\Documents\GitHub\timeofthegame\NFM\
			Then start the local server:
			http-server -p 8000
		Lastly open up the web page using chrome
			Open a chrome browser, type into the location:
			localhost:8000
			press f11 to full screen it, then refresh the page
		NOTE!!!!: the OSC bridge will likely error out because the of refresh of the web page
			check by alt-tabbing to the command prompt with the OSC bridge,
			 if it looks like it has stopped running then restart it [press up, then enter]
			 and then refresh the webpage again.  
			 Go back and forth with this until it seems like the OSC bridge is working
			[to verify that it is working: in the webpage you can right click, ’inspect element’
			 and look at the console, if it says it sent the OSC message then you’re good]
		move the mouse away
Audio computer:
	Start up the Max patch.
	If everything is working then the OSC messages should be displaying in the Max console
	[Ask Mark for anything else]

The visual settings on the Cinema computer
EYEFINITY
	This is the software that merges the three screens into one large screen
	If, for some reason, this needs to be reset:
		Right click on the desktop, select AMD FirePro Control Center
		In the new control panel that pops up, select ‘Create Eyefinity Group’
		Verify that the screens are in the correct order with ‘Identify All’
		Scroll down, click ‘Use current arrangement’
		Click Next

IMMERSAVIEW WARP
	This is the software that does the warping and blending - should start upon computer boot
	To adjust this:
		Right click on the desktop, select Immersaview Warp, select Open
		This might open up two panels - 
			one with the control instructions
			and one with the actual interface/options
		Close the control instructions panel if that opened
		To load a previously configured file, under ‘Advanced Setup’
			select ‘Configuration Files’ 
			open the correct file.  probably saved at:
				C:\Users\OCR\Documents\Immersaview\
		To do it from the start select Express Setup:
			Note: press P to switch up the patterns for blending/warping
			Press SPACE to switch between blend and warp modes
			WARPING
				Start with the overlap %, choose a percent that seems about right
				Keep clicking apply to check until it fits
				Then click the configure button to actually warp the screen
					To add control points, mouse over the desired screen	
					Press F1/F2 to remove/add horizontal control points
					Press F3/F4 to remove/add horizontal control points
				It’s probably best to make the overall moves first [eg with fewer control points]
					And then add more control points as additional warping is required
			BLENDING
				Click and drag the hexagons to change the blending zone
				Scroll up and down on the hexagons to change the gamma
		When done, press Escape
		In step 3, click Save, and also check ‘run on login’ so that it starts on login
		Then click Save at the bottom	
	Once that is done, save the config file to a location just in case
		Click Advanced Setup > Configuration Files and click ‘Save as…’
		Save it to:
				C:\Users\OCR\Documents\Immersaview\
